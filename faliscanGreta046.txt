SUMMARY
This is one of the two kylikes found in the La Penna necropolis in Falerii Veteres. These two kylikes (Vetter 244 a-b; Giacomelli 5 I-II; Bakkum 59-60) are very similar one to each other: they report (quite) the same inscription and they have a portrayal of an erotic scene. Archaeologists have found another kylix that seems like the first two but without inscription on it. Thus, probably the kylikes were produced in a series (see note 5, page 173 «Rigobianco 2015»)

HAND, SCRIPT, AND DECORATION
#palaeographicNotes: The graphemes used for denoting -r- on carefo and cra have different shape. To explain this graphic difference some scholars have suggested that the two different graphemes could denote different phonemes, respectively [r] and [z]. According to this, the second grapheme was used to represent a not yet completely rhotacized /s/ (see for example «Bonfante 1966»). This suggestion is not accepted anymore and now the difference between the two graphemes for -r- is explained as graphic variants due to an error made during the transcription of the text from a prevous copy (see for example «Rigobianco 2015»)
#alphabet: “Faliscan alphabet”
#punctuation
#decoNote: The two kylikes (Vetter 244 a-b; Giacomelli 5 I-II; Bakkum 59-60) are painted on the inside and on the outside. Oppisite to the inscription there is a geometrical decoration that skirts around the border. These geometric figures seem like spirals. There is also a decoration on the centre of the tondi with two red-varnished figures. There is a nude woman and a nude man. The latter has a cloak on his shoulders. Some scholars have interpreted that as an erotic scene (see for example «Giacomelli 1963»), others have interpreted it as an image of Dionysus with Semele or Dionysus with Ariadne (for the references see note 41, page 49 «Giacomelli 1963» and note 224, page 434 «Bakkum 2009»). On the right side of the tondi, there are a plant and a big bird, probably an owl

COMMENTARY
NOTES
@46: Some scholars have interpreted this inscription as a popular saying (see for example «Vetter 1953»; «Giacomelli 1963»), others as an invite to drink wine every day (see «Rigobianco 2015»). This latter suggestion is based to the fact that is always “today” for those who read the inscription on the kylix, thus they promise that tomorrow they are not going to drink but tomorrow will never come. Moreover, «Vetter 1953» has underlined that this phrase could be a saturnian
@46.1.1: According to «Giacomelli 1963», the variation between #f-/#h- that is recorded in Faliscan words like #word: “foied” @45.1.1 /hoied is due to sociolinguistics influences. On the other hand, «Bakkum 2009» suggested that this is an hypercorrected form for hoied (*/hō(d)+diē(d)/). The hypercorrectism should be the reflex of the Middle Faliscan development from */#fV to [*hV]
@46.1.3: The verbal forms #word: “pipafo” @45.1.3 / #word: “pafo” @46.1.3 have been largely debated by scholars. There are two opposite positions concerning this phenomenon: on one hand pipafo and pafo could be interpreted (and thus they have to be explained) as two concomitant forms (see for example «Giacomelli 1963»), on the other hand pafo could be interpreted as an error for pipafo (see «Bakkum 2009» and «Rigobianco 2015»
